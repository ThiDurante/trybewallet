# Trybe Wallet

A wallet app to keep count and plan your expenses! It consults an API to convert the currency of the expense into brazilian reais.

With a simple login verification the user must enter a valid email and a password at least 6 digits long, there is no DB connected in this app so it works with Redux State and browser local storage!

## Installation and use

This is quite a simple one!
All you need is node 16 || 18

You can do:

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:ThiDurante/trybewallet.git
  cd trybewallet
  npm i
  npm start
```

And the App will be working on port 3000 of the localhost!

From here you can login and use the wallet :)
